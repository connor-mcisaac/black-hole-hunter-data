# black-hole-hunter-data
This repository contains code to produce visual and audio representations of LIGO data for http://blackholehunter.org
The code relies heavily on the python module PyCBC, a module of tools for use in gravitational wave astronomy. Documentation can be found at http://pycbc.org/pycbc/latest/html/
All the data used is open to the public and can be found at https://www.gw-openscience.org/about/ as well as tutorials on accessing and using the data.
